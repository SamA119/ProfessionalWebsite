        <h1>Where It All Began</h1>
		</div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From first grade I have always wanted to become a teacher. Growing up, that was the only profession I observed every single day. After entering high-school I began to develop an interest in math. I did well in all my math classes and somewhere in the back of my head I knew, I'd do something related to math. In senior year of high school, 
		I decided to take an AP Computer Science class, because I had space for one more free elective. Looking at my grades in math, my counselor recommended me to take this AP class. So, I thought okay I'll give it a try. And wow did that change my life. As each day passed I learned more and more about logics and how computers work. 
		That was my first period class, and to be honest I actually looked forward to going to that class. As the semester went by I realized my passion for computer science and by that time I had already applied to colleges with a major in education. </p>
		
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; You would be surprised to know that I had not even applied to Illinois Institute of Technolgy at that time. One day after school, I decided I was going to petition for a major change in all the colleges I applied to, and that is when I first filled out my application to attend IIT, as it was known for computer science. It was a little late, but I still had a couple of days left until the deadline . 
		I wrote the required essays and submitted my application the next day. 
		After a couple of weeks I heard back from IIT, with an acceptance letter! I was excited I found my path and knew I would soon be a hawk. </p>
